# Webapp Demo for conference app Encore Design

This is just a quick demonstration of how the conference app can be more accessible to screen readers and for people who use scanning methods to navigate around the page. This demo concentrates on the front end features and design of the app.   

The design is similar to that of the demo supplied by Encore. For reasons of simplicity and ease of use, this demo uses the Bootstrap Framework. The accessibility improvements can be implemented in any workflow. This demo is just a visual representation / prototype of the features needed with the conference app in order to have everyone on the same page with expectations for the app.  

The second big feature required by ISAAC is the ability to use the app offline. This demo will implements a progressive web app feature called a service worker which caches the web app information locally on the device, it also allows the webpage to look and feel like a native App on all devices.  

A troubleshooting suggestion, for the best results with running the conference app offline and with the native look and feel use either Chrome or Firefox web browser. Both browsers are available on all platforms. Other browsers such as Safari and the new Microsoft Edge are adding support for Progressive Web App features frequently. By the time the conference takes place it may not matter which browser a person uses, but for now we should suggest Chrome or Firefox.  

Another feature of the conference App in this demo is the ability to create and save a personal schedule of the events / sessions one will attend throughout the conference.
